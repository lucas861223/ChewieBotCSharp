# ChewieBot

This is a Twitch.TV chat bot, specifically designed to have functionality for music streamers.

This is currently a Work In Progress and is not functional.
There are minimal/no comments for now, as pretty much everything may change. Comments/docs will be added as things get more stable.

## Planned Features

- TypeScript scripting for custom commands
- Integration with various platforms for music requests (Youtube, Spotify, Soundcloud, Vimeo, etc)
- Integration with OBS to allow simple adding and editing of OBS alerts.
- Integration with StreamTip to allow notifications about donations.
- Song Queue system that provides detailed information about song requests
- User VIP system that allows customisation of VIP levels, and how those levels affect users
- Automated user functionality for certain events - e.g. Donations, Subscriptions, Bit Donations
- Drag and Drop designer for OBS alerts
